# Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation 🖼️🔐

This project demonstrates a simple *image encryption and decryption technique* using *pixel manipulation* in Python.  
Pixel values are modified using a secret key to secure the image.

## Project Overview
Image encryption protects images from unauthorized access.  
In this project, each pixel’s RGB value is altered using a mathematical operation with a secret key.  
The same key is required to decrypt the image and restore it to its original form.
